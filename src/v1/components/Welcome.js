/**
 * Welcome to World's most awesome Trivia game
 * We will ask you ten random questions
 * These questions can be anything.
 *
 * At the end of this game you will receive a score between 0 to 10 which determines your Personality trait/anything
 *
 * Honorable mention -  Kudos to Tejas Kumar for the motivation <3
 *
 * At the last page it will have somrthing like - Are you ready?!? and then a Lets's start button, or Aight, Let's Go!!!
 *
 * This button can have some animation when we hover - it can be like gol gol ghumna inside the button borders, without jeopardising the text
 *
 * IDEA 1. No need of so many welcome pages. Just one will be fine. Later on in v2, we can add more data.
 *
 * IDEA 2: No routing required. Do it all in one page.
 *
 * IDEA 3: Once we click Let's go, we can display something like All the best/ happy answering / choose the best etc.
